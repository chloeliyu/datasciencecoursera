| Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often,
| missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be carefully studied
| to see if there's an underlying pattern or cause for their missingness.

...

  |====                                                                    |   5%
| In R, NA is used to represent any value that is 'not available' or 'missing'
| (in the statistical sense). In this lesson, we'll explore missing values
| further.

...

|=======                                                                 |  10%
| Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To illustrate,
| let's create a vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign it to a variable x.

> x<-c(44,NA,5,NA)

| You are amazing!

  |===========                                                             |  15%
| Now, let's multiply x by 3.

> x*3
[1] 132  NA  15  NA

| You are quite good my friend!
  
  |==============                                                          |  20%
| Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with the NA
| values in x are also NA.

...

|==================                                                      |  25%
| To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing 1000
| draws from a standard normal distribution with y <- rnorm(1000).

> y<-rnorm(1000)

| You're the best!

  |======================                                                  |  30%
| Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA, 1000).

> z<-rep(NA,1000)

| Great job!
  
  |=========================                                               |  35%
| Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values (combining
| y and z) such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up with or what
| positions they'll occupy in our final vector -- my_data <- sample(c(y, z),
                                                                    | 100).

> my_data<-sample(c(y,z),100)

| Great job!
  
  |=============================                                           |  40%
| Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The
| is.na() function tells us whether each element of a vector is NA. Call is.na()
| on my_data and assign the result to my_na.

> my_na<-is.na(my_data)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

|================================                                        |  45%
| Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.

> my_na
[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[13]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[25] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
[37]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
[49] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
[61]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
[73]  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
[85] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
[97] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE

| Nice work!
  
  |====================================                                    |  50%
| Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is NA.
| Likewise, everywhere you see a FALSE, you know the corresponding element of
| my_data is one of our random draws from the standard normal distribution.

...

|========================================                                |  55%
| In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the `==`
| operator as a method of testing for equality between two objects. So, you might
| think the expression my_data == NA yields the same results as is.na(). Give it
| a try.

> my_data==NA
[1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
[26] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
[51] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
[76] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

| You nailed it! Good job!
  
  |===========================================                             |  60%
| The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but
| just a placeholder for a quantity that is not available. Therefore the logical
| expression is incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector of the same
| length as my_data that contains all NAs.

...

|===============================================                         |  65%
| Don't worry if that's a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be cautious
| when using logical expressions anytime NAs might creep in, since a single NA
| value can derail the entire thing.

...

|==================================================                      |  70%
| So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a TRUE
| for every NA and FALSE for every numeric value, we can compute the total number
| of NAs in our data.

...

|======================================================                  |  75%
| The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as the
| number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take the sum of a bunch of
| TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.

...

|==========================================================              |  80%
| Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the total
| number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total number of NAs in my_data. Don't
| assign the result to a new variable.

> sum(my_na)
[1] 56

| All that hard work is paying off!
  
  |=============================================================           |  85%
| Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let's take a look at the data to convince ourselves
| that everything 'adds up'. Print my_data to the console.

| Index vectors come in four different flavors -- logical vectors, vectors of
| positive integers, vectors of negative integers, and vectors of character
| strings -- each of which we'll cover in this lesson.

| Let's start by indexing with logical vectors. One common scenario when working
| with real-world data is that we want to extract all elements of a vector that
| are not NA (i.e. missing data). Recall that is.na(x) yields a vector of logical
| values the same length as x, with TRUEs corresponding to NA values in x and
| FALSEs corresponding to non-NA values in x.

...

| What do you think x[is.na(x)] will give you?

1: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
2: A vector of all NAs
3: A vector of length 0
4: A vector with no NAs

Selection: 1

| Not quite! Try again.

| Remember that is.na(x) tells us where the NAs are in a vector. So if we subset
| x based on that, what do you expect to happen?

1: A vector with no NAs
2: A vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
3: A vector of length 0
4: A vector of all NAs

| That's the answer I was looking for.

| Recall that `!` gives us the negation of a logical expression, so !is.na(x) can
| be read as 'is not NA'. Therefore, if we want to create a vector called y that
| contains all of the non-NA values from x, we can use y <- x[!is.na(x)]. Give it
| a try.

| In this case, we request only values of x that are both non-missing AND greater

| I've already shown you how to subset just the first ten values of x using
| x[1:10]. In this case, we're providing a vector of positive integers inside of
| the square brackets, which tells R to return only the elements of x numbered 1
| through 10.

...

|===================================                                     |  49%
| Many programming languages use what's called 'zero-based indexing', which means
| that the first element of a vector is considered element 0. R uses 'one-based
| indexing', which (you guessed it!) means the first element of a vector is
| considered element 1.

...

  |=====================================                                   |  51%
| Can you figure out how we'd subset the 3rd, 5th, and 7th elements of x? Hint --
  | Use the c() function to specify the element numbers as a numeric vector.

> x[c(3,5,7)]
[1] 0.5808623        NA        NA

| You are really on a roll!
  
  |=======================================                                 |  54%
| It's important that when using integer vectors to subset our vector x, we stick
| with the set of indexes {1, 2, ..., 40} since x only has 40 elements. What
| happens if we ask for the zeroth element of x (i.e. x[0])? Give it a try.

> x[0]
numeric(0)

| Excellent work!

  |=========================================                               |  56%
| As you might expect, we get nothing useful. Unfortunately, R doesn't prevent us
| from doing this. What if we ask for the 3000th element of x? Try it out.

> x[3000]
[1] NA

| Keep up the great work!
  
  |==========================================                              |  59%
| Again, nothing useful, but R doesn't prevent us from asking for it. This should
| be a cautionary tale. You should always make sure that what you are asking for
| is within the bounds of the vector you're working with.

...

|============================================                            |  62%
| What if we're interested in all elements of x EXCEPT the 2nd and 10th? It would
| be pretty tedious to construct a vector containing all numbers 1 through 40
| EXCEPT 2 and 10.

...

  |==============================================                          |  64%
| Luckily, R accepts negative integer indexes. Whereas x[c(2, 10)] gives us ONLY
| the 2nd and 10th elements of x, x[c(-2, -10)] gives us all elements of x EXCEPT
| for the 2nd and 10 elements.  Try x[c(-2, -10)] now to see this.

  |==================================================                      |  69%
| So far, we've covered three types of index vectors -- logical, positive
| integer, and negative integer. The only remaining type requires us to introduce
| the concept of 'named' elements.

...

|====================================================                    |  72%
| Create a numeric vector with three named elements using vect <- c(foo = 11, bar
                                                                    | = 2, norf = NA).

> vect<-c(foo=11,bar=2,norf=NA)

| You are doing so well!
  
  |======================================================                  |  74%
| When we print vect to the console, you'll see that each element has a name. Try
| it out.

> vect
 foo  bar norf 
  11    2   NA 

| Nice work!

  |=======================================================                 |  77%
| We can also get the names of vect by passing vect as an argument to the names()
| function. Give that a try.

> names(vect)
[1] "foo"  "bar"  "norf"

| Nice work!

  |=========================================================               |  79%
| Alternatively, we can create an unnamed vector vect2 with c(11, 2, NA). Do that
| now.

> vect2<-c(11,2,NA)

| Great job!

  |===========================================================             |  82%
| Then, we can add the `names` attribute to vect2 after the fact with
| names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf"). Go ahead.

> names(vect2)<-c("foo","bar","norf")

| You're the best!
  
  |=============================================================           |  85%
| Now, let's check that vect and vect2 are the same by passing them as arguments
| to the identical() function.

> identical(vect,vect2)
[1] TRUE

| Keep up the great work!

  |===============================================================         |  87%
| Indeed, vect and vect2 are identical named vectors.

...

  |=================================================================       |  90%
| Now, back to the matter of subsetting a vector by named elements. Which of the
| following commands do you think would give us the second element of vect?

1: vect["bar"]
2: vect[bar]
3: vect["2"]

Selection: 1

| You are really on a roll!

  |==================================================================      |  92%
| Now, try it out.

> vect["bar"]
bar 
  2 

| You are amazing!

  |====================================================================    |  95%
| Likewise, we can specify a vector of names with vect[c("foo", "bar")]. Try it
| out.

> vect[c("foo","bar")]
foo bar 
 11   2 

| You are amazing!

  |======================================================================  |  97%
| Now you know all four methods of subsetting data from vectors. Different
| approaches are best in different scenarios and when in doubt, try it out!

| In this lesson, we'll cover matrices and data frames. Both represent
| 'rectangular' data types, meaning that they are used to store tabular data,
| with rows and columns.

...

  |==                                                                      |   3%
| The main difference, as you'll see, is that matrices can only contain a single
| class of data, while data frames can consist of many different classes of data.

...

| Let's create a vector containing the numbers 1 through 20 using the `:`
| operator. Store the result in a variable called my_vector.

> my_vector<-c(1:20)

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| You learned about the `:` operator in the lesson on sequences. If you wanted to
| create a vector containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (in that order), you could
| use either c(1, 2, 3) or 1:3. In this case, we want the numbers 1 through 20
| stored in a variable called my_vector. Also, remember that you don't need the
| c() function when using `:`.

> my_vector<-1:20

| Keep up the great work!
  
  |======                                                                  |   8%

  |========                                                                |  11%
| The dim() function tells us the 'dimensions' of an object. What happens if we
| do dim(my_vector)? Give it a try.

> dim(my_vector)
NULL

| Great job!

  |==========                                                              |  14%
| Clearly, that's not very helpful! Since my_vector is a vector, it doesn't have
| a `dim` attribute (so it's just NULL), but we can find its length using the
| length() function. Try that now.

> length(my_vector)
[1] 20

| You're the best!

  |============                                                            |  17%
| Ah! That's what we wanted. But, what happens if we give my_vector a `dim`
| attribute? Let's give it a try. Type dim(my_vector) <- c(4, 5).

> dim(my_vector)<-c(4,5)

| Keep up the great work!

  |==============                                                          |  19%
| It's okay if that last command seemed a little strange to you. It should! The
| dim() function allows you to get OR set the `dim` attribute for an R object. In
| this case, we assigned the value c(4, 5) to the `dim` attribute of my_vector.

...

|================                                                        |  22%
| Use dim(my_vector) to confirm that we've set the `dim` attribute correctly.

> dim(my_vector)
[1] 4 5

| You are really on a roll!

  |==================                                                      |  25%
| Another way to see this is by calling the attributes() function on my_vector.
| Try it now.

> attributes(my_vector)
$dim
[1] 4 5


| You are really on a roll!

  |====================                                                    |  28%
| Just like in math class, when dealing with a 2-dimensional object (think
| rectangular table), the first number is the number of rows and the second is
| the number of columns. Therefore, we just gave my_vector 4 rows and 5 columns.

...

  |======================                                                  |  31%
| But, wait! That doesn't sound like a vector any more. Well, it's not. Now it's
| a matrix. View the contents of my_vector now to see what it looks like.

> my_vector
[,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    5    9   13   17
[2,]    2    6   10   14   18
[3,]    3    7   11   15   19

  |========================                                                |  33%
| Now, let's confirm it's actually a matrix by using the class() function. Type
| class(my_vector) to see what I mean.

> class(my_vector)
[1] "matrix" "array" 

| Excellent job!
  
  |==========================                                              |  36%
| Sure enough, my_vector is now a matrix. We should store it in a new variable
| that helps us remember what it is. Store the value of my_vector in a new
| variable called my_matrix.

> my_matrix<-my_vector

| That's a job well done!

  |============================                                            |  39%
| The example that we've used so far was meant to illustrate the point that a
| matrix is simply an atomic vector with a dimension attribute. A more direct
| method of creating the same matrix uses the matrix() function.

...

|==============================                                          |  42%
| Bring up the help file for the matrix() function now using the `?` function.

> ?matrix()

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info()
| for more options.

| The command ?matrix will do the trick.

> ?matrix

| You are quite good my friend!
  
  |================================                                        |  44%
| Now, look at the documentation for the matrix function and see if you can
| figure out how to create a matrix containing the same numbers (1-20) and
| dimensions (4 rows, 5 columns) by calling the matrix() function. Store the
| result in a variable called my_matrix2.

> my_matrix2<-matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)

| You are really on a roll!
  
  |==================================                                      |  47%
| Finally, let's confirm that my_matrix and my_matrix2 are actually identical.
| The identical() function will tell us if its first two arguments are the same.
| Try it out.

> identical(my_matrix,my_matrix2)
[1] TRUE

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |====================================                                    |  50%
| Now, imagine that the numbers in our table represent some measurements from a
| clinical experiment, where each row represents one patient and each column
| represents one variable for which measurements were taken.

...

  |======================================                                  |  53%
| We may want to label the rows, so that we know which numbers belong to each
| patient in the experiment. One way to do this is to add a column to the matrix,
| which contains the names of all four people.

...

  |========================================                                |  56%
| Let's start by creating a character vector containing the names of our patients
| -- Bill, Gina, Kelly, and Sean. Remember that double quotes tell R that
| something is a character string. Store the result in a variable called
| patients.

> patients<-c("Bill","Gina","Kelly","Sean")

| Excellent job!
  
  |==========================================                              |  58%
| Now we'll use the cbind() function to 'combine columns'. Don't worry about
| storing the result in a new variable. Just call cbind() with two arguments --
  | the patients vector and my_matrix.

> cbind(patient,my_matrix)
Error in cbind(patient, my_matrix) : object 'patient' not found
> cbind(patients,my_matrix)
patients                       
[1,] "Bill"   "1" "5" "9"  "13" "17"
[2,] "Gina"   "2" "6" "10" "14" "18"
[3,] "Kelly"  "3" "7" "11" "15" "19"
[4,] "Sean"   "4" "8" "12" "16" "20"

| You are really on a roll!
  
  |============================================                            |  61%
| Something is fishy about our result! It appears that combining the character
| vector with our matrix of numbers caused everything to be enclosed in double
| quotes. This means we're left with a matrix of character strings, which is no
| good.

...

  |==============================================                          |  64%
| If you remember back to the beginning of this lesson, I told you that matrices
| can only contain ONE class of data. Therefore, when we tried to combine a
| character vector with a numeric matrix, R was forced to 'coerce' the numbers to
| characters, hence the double quotes.

...

  |================================================                        |  67%
| This is called 'implicit coercion', because we didn't ask for it. It just
| happened. But why didn't R just convert the names of our patients to numbers?
| I'll let you ponder that question on your own.

...

|==================================================                      |  69%
| So, we're still left with the question of how to include the names of our
| patients in the table without destroying the integrity of our numeric data. Try
| the following -- my_data <- data.frame(patients, my_matrix)

> my_data<-data.frame(patients,my_matrix)

| That's the answer I was looking for.

|====================================================                    |  72%
| Now view the contents of my_data to see what we've come up with.

> my_data
  patients X1 X2 X3 X4 X5
1     Bill  1  5  9 13 17
2     Gina  2  6 10 14 18
3    Kelly  3  7 11 15 19
4     Sean  4  8 12 16 20

| You got it right!

  |======================================================                  |  75%
| It looks like the data.frame() function allowed us to store our character
| vector of names right alongside our matrix of numbers. That's exactly what we
| were hoping for!
  
  ...

|========================================================                |  78%
| Behind the scenes, the data.frame() function takes any number of arguments and
| returns a single object of class `data.frame` that is composed of the original
| objects.

...

|==========================================================              |  81%
| Let's confirm this by calling the class() function on our newly created data
| frame.

> class(my_data)
[1] "data.frame"

| You are quite good my friend!

  |============================================================            |  83%
| It's also possible to assign names to the individual rows and columns of a data
| frame, which presents another possible way of determining which row of values
| in our table belongs to each patient.

...

|==============================================================          |  86%
| However, since we've already solved that problem, let's solve a different
| problem by assigning names to the columns of our data frame so that we know

| Since we have six columns (including patient names), we'll need to first create
| a vector containing one element for each column. Create a character vector
| called cnames that contains the following values (in order) -- "patient",
| "age", "weight", "bp", "rating", "test".

> cnames<-c("patient","age","weight","bp","rating","test")

| Your dedication is inspiring!

| Now, use the colnames() function to set the `colnames` attribute for our data
| frame. This is similar to the way we used the dim() function earlier in this
| lesson.

> colnames(my_data)
[1] "patients" "X1"       "X2"       "X3"       "X4"       "X5"      

| Almost! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

| Try colnames(my_data) <- cnames.

> colnames(my_data)<-cnames

| That's correct!

| Let's see if that got the job done. Print the contents of my_data.

> my_data
  patient age weight bp rating test
1    Bill   1      5  9     13   17
2    Gina   2      6 10     14   18
3   Kelly   3      7 11     15   19
4    Sean   4      8 12     16   20

| In this lesson, you learned the basics of working with two very important and
| common data structures -- matrices and data frames. There's much more to learn
| and we'll be covering more advanced topics, particularly with respect to data
| frames, in future lessons.
